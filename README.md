### `The login form accepts the following data:`

<li>username: Admin</li>
<li>password: 12345</li>
<br>
if you enter incorrect data, we will get the message "Disabled".

If the correct data is entered, then redirects to the profile page
<br>

authorization information is stored in the
`localStorage`
of the browser, by simple 
`true / false` 
parameter. the database was not implemented.

everything you need is thrown through the Redax
